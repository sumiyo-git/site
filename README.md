## INTRO
阿呆鳥「Ahoudori」, A minimal blog system for developers who want full control and clarity.

Vue.js? Node.js? Next.js? Hey! We're talking about a personal blog! Forget about these complicated tools and embrace native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To build a blog system that everyone can understand — that's all we want.
